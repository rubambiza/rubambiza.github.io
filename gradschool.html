                        <b>TL;DR</b>: If you want to <b>pay to think</b> and (maybe) make a lot of money now, do an <b>M.Eng</b>.
                        If you want to <b>get paid to think</b>, do an <b>M.Sc or Ph.D</b>. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="regulartext">
                        The question whether to do a Master's or a Ph.D. completely depends on what you want out of your
                        graduate studies. One on hand, if you are interested in going to industry or getting a higher starting
                        salary, getting a master's is a great choice. On the other hand, for most jobs as professors in academia
                        or research labs at major companies, a Ph.D is generally required. Because a Ph.D is a 4-6 year commitment,
                        I briefly describe the three main options available based on your interests.
                    </p>
                    <p class="regulartext">
                        First, for students with little interest in conducting research, a good alternative is 
                        a <b>Master's of Engineering (M.Eng)</b>. An M.Eng simply entails taking more classes, possibly with a capstone
                        project at the end, to graduate in approximately <b>1 year</b>. Easy right? Keep in mind that you may have
                        to <b>pay out of pocket</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="regulartext">
                        Second, for students who are interested in conducting research, but are unsure of doing a Ph.D, a
                        <b>Master's  of Science (M.Sc)</b> is a good option. Generally, the M.Sc takes <b>2 years</b> and requires taking
                        classes and completing a research thesis, with the option to continue on the Ph.D. Depending on the institution,
                        the M.Sc maybe <b>paid for by the university</b> if the student works as a Teaching Assistant for the duration of
                        their studies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="regulartext">
                        Lastly, the <b>Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D)</b> is suitable for individuals who are certain that they want
                        to conduct research and to become professors or work in labs at places like Microsoft or Facebook
                        Research. Remember this is a commitment of <b>4-6 years</b>. For most programs in CS, the Ph.D is 
                        <b>completely paid for</b> with the exceptions of minimal fees.<br>
                        I recommend checking out the funding tab if you are a prospective or current graduate student, but you are
                        unsure of how you will pay for it.

                        Welcome undergrads! If you're here, it is likely because you want to obtain a graduate degree, or,
                        at least, get some research experience to decide whether a graduate degree is the best path for your
                        career. To start, I cannot emphasize it enough that a graduate degree, with the exception of an M.Eng,
                        is not similar to your undergraduate journey. Unlike undergrad where you simply absorb knowledge and get
                        tested on your understanding, you are expected to <b>conduct research with the goal of creating new
                        knowledge.</b><br> If you are not sold that you want to get a graduate degree, no worries! I provide
                        below links to opportunities for summer research and workshops where you can sort of "test drive" life
                        as a graduate student in Computer Science.

                            writing <b>research statements</b>, optionally a <b>personal statement</b>,
                            taking and sending <b>GRE scores</b> (now optional at some institutions like Cornell),
                            <b>TOEFL scores</b> (for international students that did not do undergrad in the U.S),
                            at least <b>three letters of recommendations</b>, and your <b>official transcripts</b>. Make sure to start
                            early because the earliest deadlines are usually December 1. That's when the early bird gets
                            the worm. In other words, the earlier you submit, the more likely you will be considered for

                        <p class="regulartext">In most cases, you need to take classes, do research, or work in industry
                            to get a letter of recommendation (LOR) from professors and supervisors. 
                            An alternative way to get an LOR is to be a Teaching or Lab Assistant for a professor. The point is
                            graduate schools want to hear from people (outside your family who love you) that can speak to your
                            research potential. Therefore, you want the professors/supervisors to write you a <b>strong</b> LOR.
                            Repeat that with me, you want a <b>strong</b> LOR! If the professor/supervisor is not comfortable giving
                            you a <b>strong</b> recommendation, then it's best to find another recommender.

                            First of all, congratulations! Second, get ready for exciting times ahead. In the first and second year,
                            you can expect to be mostly taking classes and doing some research. You get flexibility in which classes
                            you take. At most institutions, you are given the first year to explore your options (sort of like dating
                            😁) before settling on one or two advisor(s). <b>More advice to come after I finish my second year.

                            The answer is a resounding YES! But, make sure that you've secured an advisor and a research agenda before
                            going for an internship in industry. In other words, refrain from doing an internship the summer after your 
                            first year. However, please take my advice with a grain of salt because this wildly varies by advisor and
                            field in CS.
